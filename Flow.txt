A - Based on your project requirements, here are the recommended concepts you should use:

1. Function (Arrow function): Arrow functions are a concise way to define functions in JavaScript. They are commonly used in React components to define event handlers and helper functions.

2. JSX and `<div>`: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your React components. The `<div>` element is commonly used as a container for other elements in React components.

3. Creating variables - `const ___ =`: Using `const` to create variables is a best practice in JavaScript for declaring variables that won't be reassigned. It helps ensure immutability and can improve code readability.

4. Functional rendering inside the app component: Functional components are the recommended way to write React components. You can define your components as functions and use them inside the main `App` component.

5. Looping through variables - `map` method: The `map` method is commonly used in React to iterate over an array and render a component for each item. It allows you to dynamically generate components based on the data.

6. Provide data to components - props: Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of child components based on the data passed to them.

7. Component composition & children props: Component composition is a powerful concept in React that allows you to combine multiple components to create more complex UIs. The `children` prop is a special prop that allows you to pass components or elements as children to a parent component.

8. Card concept: The card concept is a common UI pattern used to display information in a visually appealing way. You can create reusable card components that accept props to customize their content.

9. Event handling - event source, handler: Event handling in React involves defining event handlers and attaching them to specific elements or components. The event source can be an HTML element or a React component, and the event handler is a function that gets executed when the event occurs.

10. useState - state management: The `useState` hook is used for managing state in functional components. It allows you to declare and update state variables, which trigger re-renders of the component when their values change.

11. Conditional return: Conditional rendering is used to conditionally render different content based on certain conditions. You can use conditional statements like `if` or the conditional (ternary) operator to determine what content to render.

12. Form toggle: Form toggling refers to showing or hiding a form based on user interaction. You can use state variables and event handlers to toggle the visibility of a form component.

13. Controlled component: Controlled components are React components where the value of an input element is controlled by React state. You can use the `onChange` event and state variables to update the value of the input and handle form submission.

14. Synthetic event - `onChange`: Synthetic events are a cross-browser wrapper around the native browser events. The `onChange` event is commonly used with input elements to handle changes in their values.

15. Mapping one state to another - `event.target.value`: You can use the `event.target.value` property to map the value of an input element to a state variable. This allows you to update the state based on user input.

16. Form validation: Form validation ensures that user input meets certain criteria before it is submitted. You can use conditional statements and validation functions to validate form inputs and display error messages.

17. React Router: React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define different routes for different pages or components in your application.

18. Navigation - Link, NavLink, useParams, search param - query string - useSearchParams: React Router provides components like `Link` and `NavLink` for navigation between different routes. The `useParams` hook allows you to access route parameters, and the `useSearchParams` hook allows you to access and manipulate query string parameters.

These concepts should cover the majority of your project requirements. If you need more advanced state management or have complex data flow requirements, you can consider using the Context API or Redux. However, for the scope of your project, the concepts listed above should be sufficient.

----------------------------------------




usecase 1 - 
if you give correct creds you get logged in and you can logout if you want


usecase 2 -
if you give incorrect creds you get the error message


usecase 3 -
should also get user not present if it is not registered 


usecase 4 -
if not present then it should be registered and registration logic starts


usecase 5 -
provide the creds and the user gets a user registered message and his creds are stored to get access when it is logging in with the same creds 


usecase 6 -
once the message gets shown go to the user he is allowed to get back to the login page 




also enhance this common sensible logic for login and registration , please don't make this look wrong
